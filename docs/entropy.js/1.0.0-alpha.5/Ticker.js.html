      * A naive way to move an object along its X-axis might be to write a main
      * loop containing the statement `obj.x += 10;` which would move the object
      * 10 units per frame. This approach suffers from the issue that it is
      * dependent on the frame rate. In other words, if your application is
      * running slowly (that is, fewer frames per second), your object will also
      * appear to move slowly, whereas if your application is running quickly
      * (that is, more frames per second), your object will appear to move
      * quickly. This is undesirable, especially in multiplayer/multi-user
      * applications.
      *
      * One solution is to multiply the speed by the amount of time that has
      * passed between rendering frames. For example, if you want your object to
      * move 600 units per second, you might write `obj.x += 600 * delta`, where
      * `delta` is the time passed since the last frame. (For convenience, let's
      * move this statement to an update() function that takes `delta` as a
      * parameter.) This way, your object will move a constant distance over
      * time. However, at low frame rates and high speeds, your object will move
      * large distances every frame, which can cause it to do strange things
      * such as move through walls. Additionally, we would like our program to
      * be deterministic. That is, every time we run the application with the
      * same input, we would like exactly the same output. If the time between
      * frames (the `delta`) varies, our output will diverge the longer the
      * program runs due to accumulated rounding errors, even at normal frame
      * rates.
      *
      * A better solution is to separate the amount of time simulated in each
      * update() from the amount of time between frames. Our update() function
      * doesn't need to change; we just need to change the delta we pass to it
      * so that each update() simulates a fixed amount of time (that is, `delta`
      * should have the same value each time update() is called). The update()
      * function can be run multiple times per frame if needed to simulate the
      * total amount of time passed since the last frame. (If the time that has
      * passed since the last frame is less than the fixed simulation time, we
      * just won't run an update() until the the next frame. If there is
      * unsimulated time left over that is less than our timestep, we'll just
      * leave it to be simulated during the next frame.) This approach avoids
      * inconsistent rounding errors and ensures that there are no giant leaps
      * through walls between frames.
      *
      * That is what is done below. It introduces a new problem, but it is a
      * manageable one: if the amount of time spent simulating is consistently
      * longer than the amount of time between frames, the application could
      * freeze and crash in a spiral of death. This won't happen as long as the
      * fixed simulation time is set to a value that is high enough that
      * update() calls usually take less time than the amount of time they're
      * simulating. If it does start to happen anyway, see `MainLoop.setEnd()`
      * for a discussion of ways to stop it.
      *
      * Additionally, see `MainLoop.setUpdate()` for a discussion of performance
      * considerations.

     * very nearly exceeds the timestep, the application will freeze and crash
     * in a spiral of death (unless it is rescued; see `MainLoop.setEnd()` for
     * an explanation of what can be done if a spiral of death is occurring).
     *
     * The exception to this is that interpolating between updates for each
     * render can increase the perceived frame rate and reduce visual
     * stuttering. See `MainLoop.setDraw()` for an explanation of how to do
     * this.
     *
     * If you are considering decreasing the simulation timestep in order to
     * raise the maximum perceived FPS, keep in mind that most monitors can't
     * display more than 60 FPS. Whether humans can tell the difference among
     * high frame rates depends on the application, but for reference, film is
     * usually displayed at 24 FPS, other videos at 30 FPS, most games are
     * acceptable above 30 FPS, and virtual reality might require 75 FPS to
     * feel natural. Some gaming monitors go up to 144 FPS. Setting the
     * timestep below 1000 / 144 is discouraged and below 1000 / 240 is
     * strongly discouraged. The default of 1000 / 60 is good in most cases.
     *
     * The simulation timestep should typically only be changed at
     * deterministic times (e.g. before the main loop starts for the first
     * time, and not in response to user input or slow frame rates) to avoid
     * introducing non-deterministic behavior. The update timestep should be
     * the same for all players/users in multiplayer/multi-user applications.
